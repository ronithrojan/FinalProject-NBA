      From a recent public health undergraduate to an eager software developer,
      I have experience in Front-End Development. I always look for challenges
      to refine my skills in software development, coming up with creative
      solutions and innovative applications. As a reliable team player, I have a
      strong foundation in communication skills to adhere to clientâ€™s need and
      promote business growth. With a passion to enrich and promote efficiency
      to peoples' lives, I am looking forward to opportunities that gives me a
      platform to innovate responsive websites, mobile apps, and internal
      frameworks.
